# Node.js Express CRUD REST API

This repository houses a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API built using Node.js and Express. With this API, users can perform basic operations on posts, including creating new posts, reading existing posts, updating posts, and deleting posts.

## Features

- **Create:** Users can create new posts by sending a POST request to the appropriate endpoint with the necessary data.
- **Read:** Existing posts can be retrieved individually or in a list by sending GET requests to the corresponding endpoints.
- **Update:** Users are able to update existing posts by sending a PUT or PATCH request along with the updated data.
- **Delete:** Posts can be deleted by sending a DELETE request to the relevant endpoint.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- **Express:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js used to build web applications and APIs.
